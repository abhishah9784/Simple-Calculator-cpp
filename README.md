The user can input multiple numbers, and the program will perform the selected operations in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.

Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.

Division: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

Exit: Ends the program.
